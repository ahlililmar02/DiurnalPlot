Diurnal Atmospheric Parameters Plotter
This project provides tools to analyze and visualize the diurnal cycle of atmospheric parameters. The Python scripts in this repository help you create diurnal plots of metrics, enabling researchers to investigate daily patterns in atmospheric parameters such as wind speed, temperature, etc. and mainly turbulent fluxes.

Features
Diurnal Averaging: Calculate mean values of turbulence parameters for each hour of the day.
Customizable Plotting: Generate diurnal cycle plots with adjustable axis labels, colors, and styles.
Data Smoothing: Optionally smooth data for better visualization.
Flexible Input: Works with datasets in CSV, Excel, or Pandas DataFrames containing time-series data.
Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
Required packages:
pandas: For data handling
matplotlib: For plotting
numpy: For numerical calculations
